    <h1>Guitars</h1>
    <h2>Classic</h2>
    <p>The classical guitar is mainly used in classical music and other styles. An acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of gut or nylon, it is a precursor of the modern steel-string acoustic and electric guitars, both of which use metal strings. Classical guitars derive from the Spanish vihuela and glittern of the 15th and 16th century. Those instruments evolved into the 17th and 18th-century baroque guitar, and by the mid-19th century, early forms of the modern classical guitar. For a right-handed player, the traditional classical guitar has 12 frets clear of the body and is properly held up by the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the sound hole. However, the right-hand may move closer to the fretboard to achieve different tonal qualities. </p>
